# Contributing to Spinalfrac FSM

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Spinalfrac FSM Framework! üöÄ It‚Äôs people like you that make this a living system.

The following guidelines are a set of rules for contributing. They are meant to make the collaboration process smooth and effective for everyone involved.

## üõ£Ô∏è How to Contribute

The general process for contributing is straightforward:

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-insight`).
4.  **Make your changes** on that branch.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
6.  **Push** your branch to your fork on GitHub.
7.  **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original `TomWardmann/spinalfrac` repository.

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

*   **Ensure your contribution aligns with the FSM's spirit.** Please read the core documentation in the `README.md` to understand the framework's philosophy.
*   **Discuss major changes first.** Before embarking on a significant change or addition, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/TomWardmann/spinalfrac/issues) to discuss it with me. This ensures your work aligns with the project's direction and prevents duplicate efforts.
*   **Keep your changes focused.** A Pull Request should ideally contain one feature, fix, or idea. This makes it easier to review and merge.
*   **Use clear and concise commit messages.** A good commit message describes what changed and why.

## üß™ Code and Content of Contributions

*   **For now, contributions are primarily about content:** refining concepts, adding analyses, suggesting new archetypes or principles.
*   **Use clear and professional English or German.**
*   **Be respectful and constructive** in all communications related to the project.

## ‚ùì Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/TomWardmann/spinalfrac/issues) or contact me directly at wardemann@gmx.net.

Thank you for helping to evolve this framework!
