# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Fractal System Model (FSM)** project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [6.5.0] - 2025-09-07
### Added
- **Core Framework:**
  - Introduced the **8+1 Universal Elements ([E1] to [E9])** as the foundational system language.
  - Defined **Dynamic Forces ([D1] to [D6])** influencing system behavior.
  - Added the **Deep Rules layer ([T1] to [T5])** for analyzing subconscious system drivers.
  - Integrated **Power Levels ([M1] to [M5])** for explicit and implicit power analysis.
- **Operational Mechanics:**
  - Created the **System State Equation `S(t)`** for quantitative system state tracking.
  - Implemented **LoopGuard Rev. 2** with adaptive parameters for preventing analysis loops and ensuring efficient iterations.
  - Introduced key metrics: **Resilience `R(t)`**, **Blind Spots `B(t)`**, **Leverage `L(t)`**, and **Evolutionary Agility `A_evo(t)`**.
- **New Modules:**
  - **Stressor-Response-Curve (SAK)** for controlled resilience testing.
  - **Multi-Loop Immune Ecosystem** model for systemic resilience.
  - **Intervention Archetypes** for targeted system influence.
- **Meta-Layer:**
  - Established **Meta-Principles** and **Procedural Rules** for model application.

### Changed
- **Reframed the entire model** from a conceptual sketch to a fully operational, living framework.
- **Enhanced conceptual depth** and practical applicability across all modules.

## [6.2.0] - 2025-09-01XX (Initial Public Release)
### Added
- Initial conceptual release of the Fractal System Model.
- Basic structure including **Spinal Layer**, **Fractal Layer**, and **Meta Layer**.
- Core principles: **"Cui Bono?"**, **"Preserve Agency"**.
