## Our Humble Discovery

Through working with real-world complexity, we noticed something interesting: 
the gap between understanding a system and effectively intervening in it 
was wider than we expected.

FSM emerged not from theoretical ambition, but from practical necessity - 
and we're sharing it in the same spirit: as fellow travelers on the journey 
of making sense of complexity.
