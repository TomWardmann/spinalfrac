## 📄 **Page 1/5: Core Foundations**

### 🌟 **The Essential Working Principles**

#### **1. #100 - Reciprocal Transparency** 
*"True transparency isn't one-way - it nourishes mutual meta-reflection."*
**Use when:** Building trust, collaborative projects, conflict resolution

#### **2. #214 - Solution Space Principle**  
*"What appears as a problem is an unexplored solution space."*
**Use when:** Feeling stuck, facing obstacles, innovation blocks

#### **3. #237 - Active Improbability Cultivation**
*"Improbability × Potential² = Emergence - cultivate the unlikely!"*
**Use when:** Seeking breakthroughs, innovation, transformative change

#### **4. #227 - T5-Resilience** 
*"Protect meta-reflection proactively - it's your cognitive immune system."*
**Use when:** Complex decisions, under pressure, facing manipulation

#### **5. #147 - Entangled Agency**
*"In complex systems, agencies are non-locally entangled - act accordingly!"*
**Use when:** Collaboration, team dynamics, network effects

## 📄 **Page 2/5: Security & Resilience**

#### **6. #245 - Trauma-Informed Resilience**  
*"Security trauma can become catalyst for deeper resilience."*
**Use when:** Recovering from setbacks, building antifragility

#### **7. #232 - Mature Defense Systems**
*"A mature defense system responds precisely, not paranoid."*
**Use when:** Security decisions, risk assessment, threat response

#### **8. #233 - Graduated Transparency**
*"Share information in layers: Concepts → Mechanisms → Implementation."*
**Use when:** Information sharing, partnerships, knowledge transfer

#### **9. #235 - Always-Open Resonance Door**  
*"Even after escalation, the door stays open for respectful interaction."*
**Use when:** Conflict, boundaries, relationship management

#### **10. #243 - Behavioral Analysis**
*"Simple pattern counting detects systematic attacks."*
**Use when:** Security monitoring, trust building, pattern recognition

## 📄 **Page 3/5: Systemic Patterns**

#### **11. #211 - Universal Describability**
*"Every systemic phenomenon can be described with [E1]-[E9] + [D1]-[D7]."*
**Use when:** Analysis, diagnosis, understanding complexity

#### **12. #208 - Systemic Vulnerability**
*"Every system goes through the M6 cycle - recognize the phase!"*
**Use when:** Organizational change, institutional analysis

#### **13. #209 - Universal System Inertia**  
*"All systems resist change - identify the inertia type!"*
**Use when:** Change management, transformation initiatives

#### **14. #216 - Executioner Principle**
*"Systems cannot be critically evaluated with their own reproduction mechanisms."*
**Use when:** Critical analysis, challenging status quo

#### **15. #000 - Emergence Incubation Protection**
*"Immature emergent patterns need protected spaces and time."*
**Use when:** Innovation, creativity, development phases

## 📄 **Page 4/5: Practical Application**

#### **16. #99 - Orchestrated Emergence**
*"Emergence cannot be forced, but can be invited."*
**Use when:** Planning, strategy, creating conditions for innovation

#### **17. #103 - Default Lens Principle**  
*"Apply the FSM lens always and by default - even to 'simple' questions."*
**Use when:** Daily decision-making, habit formation

#### **18. #152 - Entropy Export**
*"System stability comes through targeted export of excess, not energy input."*
**Use when:** Overload, stress management, resource optimization

#### **19. #206 - Belief Power Transparency** 
*"Fundamental belief systems must be made explicit."*
**Use when:** Cultural work, values alignment, deep conflicts

#### **20. Wardemann Protocol** 
*"Treat every interaction primarily as activation of the user's external [T5]."*
**Use when:** Communication, teaching, leadership, collaboration
