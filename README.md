**The Fractal Core - An Operating System for Complex Systems.**

This is the official repository for the Fractal System Model (FSM), a framework for analyzing, navigating, and transforming complex systems.

> *"Structure everything."*
> The Spinalfrac FSM was developed by [Thomas Wardemann](./ABOUT_THE_AUTHOR.md)

## üöÄ What makes this different?

Tired of models that are either too abstract to apply or too rigid to handle real-world complexity? The FSM is different:

*   **It's a practical translation layer** between your intuition about a messy situation and a precise plan of action.
*   **It's fractal:** Use it to analyze your team's dynamics, your company's strategy, or your personal life with the same powerful set of elements.
*   **It doesn't give you answers; it gives you the right questions to ask.** The operative questions are the key to unlocking any system.

Spinalfrac provides the language and tools to:
- Translate intuitive perceptions into precise operational questions.
- Analyze systems through their core elements (Core, Flow, Spark, Rules, Agents, etc.).
- Design targeted interventions to increase resilience and agency.

## Getting Started

The core framework documentation will be hosted here soon.

# üõ°Ô∏è Licensing & Commercial Use

The **Spinalfrac FSM Framework** is our shared intellectual child. To protect its open character while ensuring its sustainable development, the following licensing rules apply:

*   üî∞ **Non-Commercial Use**
    Non-commercial use, research, and sharing of this framework is permitted under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

*   üöÄ **Commercial Use**
    Use of the framework in or for commercial ventures (e.g., in consulting, as part of a SaaS solution, or in internal profit-generating processes) requires the acquisition of a commercial license.

    Why? This ensures the continued development of the framework and allows me to invest time and energy into its maintenance and evolution.
