**The Fractal Core - An Operating System for Complex Systems.**

This is the official repository for the Fractal System Model (FSM), a framework for analyzing, navigating, and transforming complex systems.

> *"Structure everything."*
> The Spinalfrac FSM was developed by Thomas Wardemann.

## Overview

Spinalfrac provides the language and tools to:
- Translate intuitive perceptions into precise operational questions.
- Analyze systems through their core elements (Core, Flow, Spark, Rules, Agents, etc.).
- Design targeted interventions to increase resilience and agency.

## Getting Started

The core framework documentation will be hosted here soon.

    Use of the framework in or for commercial ventures (e.g., in consulting, as part of a SaaS solution, or in internal profit-generating processes) requires the acquisition of a commercial license.

    Why? This ensures the continued development of the framework and allows me to invest time and energy into its maintenance and evolution.
