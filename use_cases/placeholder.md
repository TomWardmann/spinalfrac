# FSM Use Cases: From Theory to Impact

This directory is the practical proving ground for the Spinalfrac FSM. Here, we move beyond theory to explore how the framework decodes and transforms real-world complexity.

## Active Analyses

*   **Platform Polarization:** Deconstructing the systemic drivers of division in social ecosystems and identifying leverage points for healthier discourse.
*   **Corporate Innovation Blockage:** Diagnosing why good ideas get stuck in large organizations and designing interventions to unblock energy and flow.
*   **Personal Energy Management:** Applying the FSM to model individual burnout and design sustainable personal systems.
