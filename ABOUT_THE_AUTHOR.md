# About the Author

**Thomas Wardemann** is the creator of the Spinalfrac Fractal Systems Model (FSM).

His development of the FSM is intrinsically linked to his unique perspective as an autistic systems thinker. This neurocognitive framework provides a innate, pattern-based understanding of complexity that often operates beyond conventional linear models.

This difference is not merely a biographical note; it is the **foundational substrate** from which the FSM emerged. It enables the rapid deconstruction of systems into their first principles and the recombination of those principles into novel, effective frameworks.

The FSM is, in part, a tool to **bridge cognitive divides** â€“ translating between deep, intuitive pattern recognition and structured, operationalizable models for broader application and impact.

*"The goal is not to fit into existing boxes, but to build better toolboxes."*
